# Session: CityBlocks GUI kickoff
**Date:** 2025-11-09
**Task IDs:** CBG-100, CBG-101 (research)
**Models consulted:** GPT-5 (Codex CLI)
**Image/Prompt IDs:** N/A
**Project Variant:** HITL
**Project Intent:** Deliver an interactive platform where the requested building block spawns centered and can be edited via a UIL-style GUI.

## Objectives
- Review `uil_3d.html` to understand the existing Three.js + UIL workflow.
- Stand up the `cityblocks-gui` project template (README, tasks, ledger, sessions).
- Capture initial backlog items for porting the scene and wiring GUI controls.

## Execution Notes
- Inspected `uil_3d.html` (Landscape, SuperSky, Water, UIL panels) to document expected controls (height/expo sliders, environment knobs, water params).
- Created `agents-hub/cityblocks-gui` from the template; authored README with snapshot, scope, and success criteria.
- Drafted `tasks.yaml` + `tasks.md` using the `CBG` prefix covering porting, centering, and GUI exposure work.
- Logged this session so future contributors know why the project exists and where to pick up.

## Capability Flags
- documentation
- research
- planning

## Lint/Test Status
- N/A (docs-only session).

## Reflection — The Good / The Bad / The Ugly
- **Good:** Project now has clear intent + backlog anchored to concrete code (uil_3d.html).
- **Bad:** No actual GUI code yet; effort is purely planning.
- **Ugly:** Legacy UIL scripts live outside the React pipeline, so integration will require bundling/interop work.

## Next Actions
- CBG-101: Build the React/R3F scene that mirrors `uil_3d.html`.
- CBG-102: Hook building selection so requested blocks spawn at the platform origin.
- CBG-103: Port key UIL control groups (material, water, sky) into the new GUI.

## Image Prompt
- Prompt ID: N/A
- Prompt Notes: Not requested.

## Quote
- "Controls mean nothing if the block isn’t centered."
